# Gabri Ansaldo

Hi, I'm Gabri Ansaldo, a Product Manager based in San Francisco with a focus on AI agents and generative AI. My work spans from leading $50M+ product portfolios at Motorola Solutions to building autonomous multi-agent systems that solve complex problems and workflows.

## About Me

I'm passionate about turning complex technical capabilities into products that people can use and trust. My work focuses on:

- **AI Agents & Generative AI**: Building autonomous multi-agent systems and agentic frameworks
- **Product Strategy**: Leading enterprise product portfolios and feature prioritization
- **Human-AI Collaboration**: Designing products at the intersection of AI and user experience
- **Research & Development**: Developing open-source frameworks for AI and multi-robot interaction

## My Projects

### AgentSpeak - Agentic Simulation Framework
A 'Market Simulation' platform capable of modeling 100k consumer personas to test policies, pricing, and messaging in realistic scenarios. Features:
- Evaluated agent alignment, consistency, and emergent behaviors through statistical analysis
- Built with LangChain, Python, LLMs, and Claude Code

### Investi - Autonomous Investing System
An autonomous investing system using multi-agent collaboration (Researcher, Analyst, Trader) to execute logic-based trading strategies without human intervention:
- Incorporates Alpaca APIs for execution
- PostgreSQL with RAG for memory search and state persistence
- LangSmith tracing for observable workflows

### Explicit Agent - Minimalist Agent Framework
A minimalist agent framework that exposes all agent logic, tool calls, and state management, enabling full transparency and user control over agent behavior.

## This Website

This is my personal portfolio website — a minimal, professional site with a terminal-style aesthetic. It's built using:

- **Astro** for static site generation
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Custom components** for the terminal-style typewriter effect
